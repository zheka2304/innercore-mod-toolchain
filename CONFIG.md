# Inner Core Mod Toolchain — Configuration

Any operations of toolchain are guided by configuration files for building the project, creating it, and setting the basic properties of templates.

There are several types of configurations, description of each properties of which is described below. If a default value exists, it is also specified.

Path selections can contain /\*\*/ to select folders and all subfolders, as well as /\* to select all files, /\*.js or /\*.jar to select all files with the desired extension.

## make.json - building project

Properties marked with \* can have absolute file paths.

```js
.

```

Basic configuration for projects. Each of properties not set here can also be obtained from toolchain configuration as a default value.

## toolchain.json — toolchain configuration

Properties marked with \* can have absolute file paths.

```js
.
├─ *projectLocations: [] // relative or absolute paths to projects, the entire folder is scanned for make.json and template.json configurations
├─ *workspaceFile: "../toolchain.code-workspace" // path to the workspace file, exclusive to Visual Studio Code, all open and created projects are added to it
│
├─ ^template: {} // info property from make.json, values are automatically filled in when creating a project, overwrites properties from the template if they are set there too
│  └─ ^skipDescription: false // skips description page when creating a project from a template, i.e. it will be enough just to enter a name, remaining properties will be taken from the template or overwritten by properties
├─ *defaultTemplate: "../toolchain-mod" // template selected by default when creating the project can be a relative or absolute path to it
│
├─ denyJavaScript: true // uses the tsc compiler even if project uses only JavaScript
├─ *debugIncludesExclude: [] // fetching declarations that tsc excludes from compilation at development helps reduce building time; if the path is not found, it will try again with absolute variant
│
├─ ^*ndkPath: null // can be specified if you already have NDK installed for compiling native code, it is recommended to use the r16b version; by default, the compiler will be searched in PATH or set by toolchain itself
├─ abis: [] // "armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a", "x86", "x86_64"
├─ debugAbi: "armeabi-v7" // main architecture for compiling native code at development stage
│
├─ pushTo // output modpack folder on device, selected on anything connection; modpack path in toolchain config, mod itself in make
├─ adb: {} // additional ADB settings
│  ├─ pushAnyLocation: false // by default, if the pushTo property does not specify installation of Inner Core pack, a warning will be issued for pushing to a strange location; this setting disables it
│  ├─ pushUnchangedFiles: true // whether all files should be pushed to the device, or only modified ones
│  └─ doNothingIfDisconnected: false // instead of prompting for device configuration in console, just terminates building process if no device is connected
├─ ^devices: [] // a list of saved devices that changes when connected during ADB setup; this contains private information, so changing it is not possible from make.json
│
├─ ^componentInstallationWithoutCommit: false // whether .commit marks are needed in installed components; if not needed, updates cannot be installed, and the component will be considered installed if a folder with it exists
└─ ^updateAcceptReplaceConfiguration: true // whether it is necessary to replace configuration files in toolchain folder of toolchain, such as .vscode/tasks.json and others; otherwise your changes will remain the same even with updates
```

Can only be created once in toolchain directory, some of properties marked with ^ cannot be changed from *make.json* to building.

## template.json - project template

> Inherits directly from *make.json* to build project, `info` property is overwritten when the project is created. In addition, properties from `info` will be applied as default values when the template is used.

If this file exists in directory and project can be found, it will later be used as a template when creating the project. Can be used in conjunction with *make.json* to build a project.
